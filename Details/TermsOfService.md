      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Bot Cyber Attacks:</b> While this is unlikely, Jonah could be
          attacked by hackers. This is extereamly unlikely and probably won't
          happen. If this happens, MilesWK or any other developers are not
          responsible for what happens related to your information or any server
          information. If Jonah is attacked, the developers are going to work to
          delete the bot and remove Jonah from all Servers and Direct Messaging
          Channels.

        <li>
          <b>Misuse of AI:</b> While the AI is moderated, it is not the
          responsibility of the developers for any misuse of the AI programmed
          into Jonah.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bad Stability of Bot or AI:</b> Jonah is still in development. If
          the AI is offline, or the bot is offline, there is most likely a very
          good reason why. You can not take any legal action against the
          developers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, <b>no legal action may be taken</b> against Discord, MilesWK, Tiago
