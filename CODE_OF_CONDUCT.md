# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Alright, I am going to keep this super simple: If you post ANYTHING inappropriate in the Jonah Status Page Form, the GitHub Discussions, or any other place, you will get banned. First time is a temporary ban and the next is permanent. It is just that simple. 😁

🐷 Oink!
